A very traditional south Indian sweet is rich and makes a perfect sweet to be made for special occasions and festivals like Diwali. History of Mysore Pak: Long Long time ago, in the Mysore Palace (in Karnataka, India), a petty little cook, made a dessert for the King. He made paagh (basically sugar syrup in the local language), then added gram flour and to make it rich and worthy for the king added loads of clarified butter to it. It dripped of butter, and glowed, the gram flour gave it the look of Gold, the sugar gave the King a rush and the entire ensemble made the King super duper happy. The King asked for the name of the desert and all the simple cook could say was Mysore Paagh ( Basically Sweet of Mysore). He was asked to open shop outside the palace and sell the Mysore Paagh, to all. The King wanted all his men to taste this. No one knows when the Paagh became paak, and since then Mysore pak, is enjoyed by one and all. These days everyone loves to buy soft and melt in the mouth Mysore Pak from Krishna Sweets and they are quite famous for it.

It is not only rich in the nutrients and fibers, that whole wheat brings along with it, but also low in fat and very light on the stomach. Traditionally Roti’s are cooked on an iron skillet and later put on direct flame for it to rise and puff. If you have never tried making these flat breads before, it can get a little overwhelming.

Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.\",\"Set the dough aside to rest covered for 15 minutes. Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions.\",\"Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat. Roll the portions of phulka (roti) dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.\",\"Take a portion of the phulka dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.\",\"Cook the rolled dough as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.\",\"Tip: It is a good idea to roll out a batch of dough so it gets easier to cook the entire batch. Although Gujarati ladies are very quick in rolling and cooking them simultaneously; this comes with practice of rolling and understanding the heat of your skillet.\",\"Place rolled dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled dough to the other side on the skillet.\",\"After a few seconds turn the flame to high; using tongs take the rolled phulka dough off the skillet and place it directly on the flame. It should balloon into a spherical shape and puff up. This is known as the phulka\",\"Remove the phulka from heat, place it on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.\",\"Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled phulka dough and keep stacking them one over the other.\",\"This process can be used if you are using a gas stove as well.\",\"Preheat an iron skillet. Place rolled phulka dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled phulka dough to the other side on the skillet.\",\"Flip over again and cook the first side pressing lightly with a napkin. The rolled out phulka dough should begin to start puffing out.\",\"Flip and cook the other side for a few more seconds.\",\"Remove from the heat, place the phulka on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up. Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled dough and keep stacking them the phulka one over the other.\",\"Serve the Phulka (Roti/ Chapati) with any Indian Gravies for a lunch or dinner.\",\"Making the rolled out phulka dough puff into a balloon comes with practice. So give yourself time if you are new to bread making.\",\"Even if yours does not puff the first time or the times after, the rotis that you have made are cooked and are edible, so you could consume them with your choice of vegetables.\",\"Using thinner rolling pins is the key, as you want to be gentle with the dough.\",\"The heavy big ones will make you press harder which might just make it tear. It’s well worth investing in a thinner rolling pin and tongs to hold the bread which is available in most Indian stores around the world.\",\"Tossing the phulka dough in flour as you roll is another helper that will make the rolling out the dough easier.\"}',\n",

Topping this chutney for chaats is an absolute must to have the best chaat experience. To make the Date Tamarind Chutney we pressure cooked the dates, tamarind and jaggery together along with some water and then blended it to make a coarse chutney with the help of a hand blender. We then added all the spices which are used to elevate the flavours of the tamarind chutney like the chili powder, cumin powder, black salt and ginger powder into the pressure cooker and simmered the chutney till it reached the right consistency. The pressure cooker method reduces the cooking time to a great extent and also helps you make the Date Tamarind Chutney in one pot.   I personally like to not puree my Date and Tamarind Chutney. I like my chutney to be chunky. To savor it the way I like, once all the ingredients are simmered well and cooled, refrigerate the Date and Tamarind Chutney and serve as desired.

I remember my childhood days when Sunday used to be dance classes in the morning, ‘Tekona Porota’ and ‘Aloo Chorchori’ for breakfast or ‘Luchi-Sada Aloor Chorchori’ for breakfast and Chicken Curry or Mutton Curry for lunch was a must. I still remember when Maa used to grind the masalas in ‘shil-nora’ (a traditional way of grinding spices with the help of a oblong stone piece on a large stone square piece). And the flavour or freshly ground spices were unparalleled to any branded spice powder. The red coloured gravy with plump big potatoes was added attraction. Even the gravy and the potatoes taste better on next day. It is a specialty of Bengali cuisine that we add vegetables specially potato in fish curry or chicken/mutton curry. This is the recipe that I have seen cooked in our home. I believe cooking and a taste is very personal thing especially for this mutton dish every family has its own recipes.  Serve this delicious   along with  for a weekend dinner. You can also serve   as a dessert to end your scrumptious meal. If you like this recipe, you can also try other Mutton recipes such as',\n",

It dripped of butter, and glowed, the gram flour gave it the look of Gold, the sugar gave the King a rush and the entire ensemble made the King super duper happy. The King asked for the name of the desert and all the simple cook could say was Mysore Paagh ( Basically Sweet of Mysore). He was asked to open shop outside the palace and sell the Mysore Paagh, to all. The King wanted all his men to taste this. No one knows when the Paagh became paak, and since then Mysore pak, is enjoyed by one and all.

We then added all the spices which are used to elevate the flavours of the tamarind chutney like the chili powder, cumin powder, black salt and ginger powder into the pressure cooker and simmered the chutney till it reached the right consistency.

       "    'description': 'Rice can be cooked in a variety of ways. Personally I find the pressure cooker method quick and effective, that can produce rice grains of different textures - from soft to grainy. There are a number of different types of rice grains available and you might choose the variety that your family has been eating for generations or you might want to try another new variety.  Each type of grain, when cooked produces different texture of the rice. The older the rice, the longer it takes to cook. The more polished the rice is, it tends to get cooked faster and also mushy if there is excess water. With practice and depending on the kind of rice you use, you will be able to arrive at the correct water proportion for cooking rice.  The   method and the  , both yield different textures of rice. If you like soft sticky rice, then pressure cooker accomplishes that very easily. If you are looking at a grainy texture then saucepan method is a better method.
