You only need to use 3 tablespoons of the paste for a single recipe of Thai curry. So with this paste you will be able to make Thai curry at least 3 times over.\",\"Next we will proceed to make the Vegetarian Thai Curry with this paste. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a heavy wok. Add in the vegetables like carrots, zucchini, broccoli and bell peppers.\",\"Add in some salt and stir fry the vegetables on high heat until lightly tender. Once tender turn off the heat and keep aside.\",\"Add a teaspoon of oil into the hot wok, next add in 2 to 3 tablespoons of the Thai curry paste and saute for a few seconds in the oil.\",\"Next add in a cup of water and stir to combine into the curry. Next we will add in a tablespoon of brown sugar and finally 400 ml of the coconut milk.\",\"Stir to combine all the ingredients. Once combined, add in the salt, stir and allow the mixture to thicken a little and come to a boil.\",\"Once the mixture comes to a boil, add in some torn basil leaves and the stir fried vegetables.
