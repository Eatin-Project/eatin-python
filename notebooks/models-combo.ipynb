A very traditional south Indian sweet is rich and makes a perfect sweet to be made for special occasions and festivals like Diwali. History of Mysore Pak: Long Long time ago, in the Mysore Palace (in Karnataka, India), a petty little cook, made a dessert for the King. He made paagh (basically sugar syrup in the local language), then added gram flour and to make it rich and worthy for the king added loads of clarified butter to it. It dripped of butter, and glowed, the gram flour gave it the look of Gold, the sugar gave the King a rush and the entire ensemble made the King super duper happy. The King asked for the name of the desert and all the simple cook could say was Mysore Paagh ( Basically Sweet of Mysore). He was asked to open shop outside the palace and sell the Mysore Paagh, to all. The King wanted all his men to taste this. No one knows when the Paagh became paak, and since then Mysore pak, is enjoyed by one and all.

A very traditional south Indian sweet is rich and makes a perfect sweet to be made for special occasions and festivals like Diwali. History of Mysore Pak: Long Long time ago, in the Mysore Palace (in Karnataka, India), a petty little cook, made a dessert for the King. He made paagh (basically sugar syrup in the local language), then added gram flour and to make it rich and worthy for the king added loads of clarified butter to it. It dripped of butter, and glowed, the gram flour gave it the look of Gold, the sugar gave the King a rush and the entire ensemble made the King super duper happy. The King asked for the name of the desert and all the simple cook could say was Mysore Paagh ( Basically Sweet of Mysore). He was asked to open shop outside the palace and sell the Mysore Paagh, to all. The King wanted all his men to taste this. No one knows when the Paagh became paak, and since then Mysore pak, is enjoyed by one and all. These days everyone loves to buy soft and melt in the mouth Mysore Pak from Krishna Sweets and they are quite famous for it.

       "    'description': ' is one of the most delicious frozen Indian desserts that can be had anytime of the year. It is very similar to western ice cream but since kulfi is not whipped it results in a solid, dense, but rich, luscious creamy indian dessert. The best Kulfi I have tasted are on the streets of Kolkata  where they sell the flavors according to seasons - Lychee Kulfi, Sitaphal (custard apple) Kulfi, Mango Kulfi to name a few. These Kulfis are set in the earthen pots and sealed to be frozen. The earthen pots lend a special flavor to the kulfi which makes them deep and earthy. If you do plan to make kulfi at home and get hold of earthen pots to make them, go ahead. Else like me you will have to stick to popsicle molds that make an equally good kulfi, but just lack the rustic taste and finish. Serve the   for your Holi or Diwali Party or when you have an elaborate Indian Dinner Menu planned for your parties. You can also serve it to your guests during festival with some delicious appetisers like   and Chaat items. If you like looking for   for parties, you can try some of our favorites.',\n",

In around 1800\\'s, this dish was Indianised by using palm vinegar instead of wine and was traditionally made with pork or beef. The further evolution of this dish happened when British ruled India - in that version the meat was marinated overnight with vinegar, ginger, garlic and spices and then cooked the next day.

       "    'description': ' or the  is a sweet and sour tangy chutney made from dates tamarind and jaggery.It is an essential component in Chaats like Pani Puri, Bhel Puri, Samosa and more. Topping this chutney for chaats is an absolute must to have the best chaat experience. To make the Date Tamarind Chutney we pressure cooked the dates, tamarind and jaggery together along with some water and then blended it to make a coarse chutney with the help of a hand blender. We then added all the spices which are used to elevate the flavours of the tamarind chutney like the chili powder, cumin powder, black salt and ginger powder into the pressure cooker and simmered the chutney till it reached the right consistency. The pressure cooker method reduces the cooking time to a great extent and also helps you make the Date Tamarind Chutney in one pot.   I personally like to not puree my Date and Tamarind Chutney. I like my chutney to be chunky. To savor it the way I like, once all the ingredients are simmered well and cooled, refrigerate the Date and Tamarind Chutney and serve as desired.

       "    'description': 'Rice can be cooked in a variety of ways. Personally I find the pressure cooker method quick and effective, that can produce rice grains of different textures - from soft to grainy. There are a number of different types of rice grains available and you might choose the variety that your family has been eating for generations or you might want to try another new variety.  Each type of grain, when cooked produces different texture of the rice. The older the rice, the longer it takes to cook. The more polished the rice is, it tends to get cooked faster and also mushy if there is excess water. With practice and depending on the kind of rice you use, you will be able to arrive at the correct water proportion for cooking rice.  The   method and the  , both yield different textures of rice. If you like soft sticky rice, then pressure cooker accomplishes that very easily. If you are looking at a grainy texture then saucepan method is a better method. Serve   with your choice of Dal, Curries or a Mixed Vegetable Raita.',\n",

Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight and allow the vegetables to cook until you hear at least 2 whistles and turn off the heat.\",\"Since the vegetables cook very quickly, we will release the pressure by running cold water over the pressure cooker.
