       "      <td>[To begin making Rajma Kofta In Milk And Poppy Seed Gravy Recipe, prepare the koftas first. Remember to first soak the rajma overnight and pressure cook with salt until the rajma is cooked and softened., Blend the boiled rajma, besan, cashew, raisins, chilli powder, hing, coriander leaves and salt in a food processor. Check for seasoning and adjust. Spread this mashed spiced rajma on a thali or a large plate. Make small round balls of rajma kofta with your palm., Heat a frying pan with half ghee and fry the kofta balls for about 10 minutes. Set aside., What you can also do is, heat a kuzhi paniyaram pan, drop in a few drops of oil into each cavity and put in these balls into each cavity. Once browned on the bottom, you can rotate the kofta balls and brown them evenly from the other side as well. This is a healthier way to prepare koftas instead of deep frying them in traditional way., Take a kadai and heat ghee, add cumin and allow to sizzle., Once sizzling, add in milk, cream, poppy seed paste and garam masala powder. Add salt and stir. Add water only if needed., Cook till the mixture comes to one boil and add the koftas and Switch off heat after half a minute. Serve with your favourite garnish like saffron or coriander leaves., Serve Rajma Kofta In Milk And Poppy Seed Gravy Recipe along with Saffron Pilaf Recipe (Kesar Pulao) and Pudina Tawa Paratha Recipe for lunch or dinner with Green Moong Sprout Salad With Capsicum And Carrots to complete the meal.]</td>\n",
